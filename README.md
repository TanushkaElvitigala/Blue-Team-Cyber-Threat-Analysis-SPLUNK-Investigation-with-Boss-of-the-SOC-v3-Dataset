# Blue-Team-Cyber-Threat-Analysis-SPLUNK-Investigation-with-Boss-of-the-SOC-v3-Dataset

As a Blue Team member, I conducted a cyber threat investigation using the Boss of the SOC v3 dataset and SPLUNK, mapping adversary actions to the Cyber Kill Chain and MITRE ATT&amp;CK frameworks.

Key Findings:

* Brute Force & Password Spraying: Attackers attempted unauthorized access from IP addresses based in the Netherlands.
* Phishing & Credential Harvesting: Macro-enabled malware (W97M.Empstage) was delivered through email.
* Exposed AWS Credentials: Leaked AWS keys allowed for privilege escalation.
* Malware Deployment: A Trojan (Backdoor.PsEmpire) provided remote access, while JSCoinminer exploited system resources.
* Command & Control (C2): Attackers communicated externally using port 3333.
*Data Exfiltration: A BCC rule forwarded sensitive emails to an attacker-controlled address.
* Lateral Movement & Persistence: Unauthorized accounts (SVCVNC, Tomcat7) were created on the network.

Mapped to Cyber Kill Chain & MITRE ATT&CK:

* Cyber Kill Chain: From Reconnaissance (scanning AWS S3 buckets) to Actions on Objectives (data exfiltration).
* MITRE ATT&CK Techniques: Credential dumping, phishing, C2 communication, privilege escalation, and data exfiltration.

Tools Used:

* Splunk: Log analysis and attack timeline reconstruction.
* VirusTotal & MITRE ATT&CK: Malware classification and behavior analysis.
* System & Network Logs: Anomaly detection and correlation.

Key Takeaways:

* Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to prevent credential abuse.
* Restrict IAM privileges to minimize the attack surface.
* Monitor and block C2 traffic to disrupt external attacker communication.
* Deploy Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions to detect malware persistence.

This project enhanced my skills in threat hunting, security monitoring, and incident response. Feel free to connect if youâ€™d like to discuss Blue Team strategies further.
